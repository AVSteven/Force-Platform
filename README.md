# Force-Platform University Project
This project was developed for the ergonomy laboratory of the Tecnologico de Costa Rica. We develop a platform that measures the force that is used on it. The signals are sent to a PSOC, which records the information with a program developed in C. We use the data captured to use the program developed here to have an interface more friendly.
